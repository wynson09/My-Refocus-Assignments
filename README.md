I am Wynson Carl Nacalaban, 29 years of age.
My hobies are playing computer games, watching animes and studying computer programing related.
My goal for this year is to learn more about web development and make myself master of this field.
When I was in college, my dream was to become a developer, but when I graduated college, I had two job opportunities.
The first is to be a Junior Web Developer. Second is working in Japan as Electronic Assembly, but I realized that this is not the job I wanted.
I decided to do the things that make me happy, which is to become a web developer.
I know being an experienced web developer will make my future better.
